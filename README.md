# Portfolio Projects 

## COVID-19 Project
Within this project, I have used SQL to explore data. The Excel dataset contains records of the number of cases, deaths, vaccinations of each country between January 2020 to April 2021. I have explored various cases such as the likelihood of dying if someone was to contract COVID in the UK, what percentage of the UK population contracted COVID, etc. I have looked at countries with the highest infection rate compared to its populations as well as as countries with the highest death count compared to its population.

I have also prepared a Tableau [dashboard](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/tasnia.begum/viz/COVIDProjectDashboard_17601155696200/Dashboard1) to visualise different cases such as the total number of deaths per continent. 

**Skills:** Data Loading, Data Exploration, Joins, Aggregate Functions, CTE's, Temp Tables, Creating Views, Data Modelling

**Tools Used:** Excel, SQL Server, Tableau 

**Code:** [Covid 19 Project](https://github.com/tasniabegum/PortfolioProjects/blob/main/COVID%20Project) 

**Visualisation:** [Covid 19 Project Dashboard](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/tasnia.begum/viz/COVIDProjectDashboard_17601155696200/Dashboard1) 



## Nashville Housing Project 
In this project, I have used SQL to clean data. The Excel dataset contains records of homes that were sold in Nashville between April 2013 to September 2016. I have cleaned the data by standardising the date format, splitting columns and removing duplicates. 

**Skills:** Data Loading, Data Cleaning, Data Parsing, CTE's

**Tools Used:** Excel, SQL Server

**Code:** [Nashville Housing Project](https://github.com/tasniabegum/PortfolioProjects/blob/main/Nashville%20Housing%20Project.sql)


## Data Professional Survey Breadown Project 
This survey has been conducted by [Alex The Analyst](https://github.com/AlexTheAnalyst). The raw Excel data contatained information collected from a survey completed by data professionalsain 2022, such as their age, gender, their current role, location etc. The data required cleaning and preparation in Power BI before visualisations could be created. Therefter, I created a dashboard to collate the visualisations. 

**Skills:** Data Cleaning, Data Analysis, BI Dashboard

**Tools Used:** Power BI

**Visualisation:** [Data Professional Survey Project (BI Dashboard)](https://github.com/tasniabegum/PortfolioProjects/blob/main/Data%20Professional%20Survery%20Project.pbix)

## Diabetes Project 
In this project, I have used a dataset from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mathchi/diabetes-data-set), originally from the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases. It was used to predict whether a patient (a woman, at least 21 years old, of Pima Indian heritage) has diabetes, from diagnostic measurements. I analysed the dataset using SQL to uncover potential patterns and factors associated with diabetes, visualise key trends with Tableau and take a data driven insight into diabetes risk factors. 

**Skills:** Data Loading, Data Exploration, Aggregate Functions,  Data Modelling

**Tools Used:** Excel, SQL Server, Tableau 

**Code:** [Diabetes Project](https://github.com/tasniabegum/PortfolioProjects/blob/main/Diabetes%20Project.sql) 

**Visualisation:** [Diabetes Project Dashboard (1 of 2)](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/tasnia.begum/viz/DiabetesProject12/Dashboard1) &
[Diabetes Project Dashboard (2 of 2)](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/tasnia.begum/viz/DiabetesProject22/Dashboard2) 

**Key Insights:**
* From the given dataset, 34.90% of the patients are diabetic.
* Glucose level is the biggest differing factor between diabetic and non diabetic patients.
* It can be seen that if glucose levels rise over a certain threshold, the chance of diabetes increases significantly.
* 50-59 year old have the highest diabetic percentage rate at 59%, alongside high glucose levels suggesting that those of a greater age are more likely to have diabetes.
* However, those over 60 have a similar high glucose level but a lower diabetic percentage rate indicating that the dataset may contain potential outliers and errors.
* A woman's total number of pregnancies does not seem to have an extensive effect on her glucose level, but there is an increased diabetic percentage rate for women with seven or more pregnancies.
