# Portfolio Projects 

## COVID-19 Project
Within this project, I have used SQL to explore data. The dataset contains records of the number of cases, deaths, vaccinations of each country in the time range of January 2020 to April 2021. I have explored various cases such as the likelihood of dying if someone was to contract COVID in the UK, what percentage of the UK population contracted COVID, etc. I have looked at countries with the highest infection rate compared to its populations as well as as countries with the highest death count compared to its population.
I have also prepared a Tableau [dashboard](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/tasnia.begum/viz/COVIDProjectDashboard_17601155696200/Dashboard1) to visualise different cases such as the total number of deaths per continent.
