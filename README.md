# Portfolio Projects 

## COVID-19 Project
Within this project, I have used SQL to explore data. The Excel dataset contains records of the number of cases, deaths, vaccinations of each country between January 2020 to April 2021. I have explored various cases such as the likelihood of dying if someone was to contract COVID in the UK, what percentage of the UK population contracted COVID, etc. I have looked at countries with the highest infection rate compared to its populations as well as as countries with the highest death count compared to its population.

I have also prepared a Tableau [dashboard](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/tasnia.begum/viz/COVIDProjectDashboard_17601155696200/Dashboard1) to visualise different cases such as the total number of deaths per continent. 

**Skills**: Data Loading, Data Exploration, Joins, Aggregate Functions, CTE's, Temp Tables, Creating Views, Data Modelling

**Code**: [Covid 19 Project](https://github.com/tasniabegum/PortfolioProjects/blob/main/COVID%20Project) 



## Nashville Housing Project 
In this project, I have used SQL to clean data. The Excel dataset contains records of homes that were sold in Nashville between April 2013 to September 2016. I have cleaned the data by standardising the date format, splitting columns and removing duplicates. 

**Skills**: Data Loading, Data Cleaning, Data Parsing, CTE's

**Tools Used**: Excel, SQL Server
